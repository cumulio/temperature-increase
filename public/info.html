    The data you see provides surface air temperature changes (⁰C) measured over
    the global land area. It covers the period 1961-2020 for 190 countries and
    38 territories. The documentation also indicates that temperature change
    data were produced in collaboration with the
    <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/"
      >NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a
    >
    (NASA–GISS).

    <strong>Disclaimer: </strong> The FOASTAT dataset includes both countries
    and territories in its area data We include all of these in our 'Area'
    selector. For more accurate average temperature increase data we suggest
    picking out countries or territories explicitly. For example, for the whole
    World, select 'World' in the Area picker.

    At the bottom you will see 2 maps next to each other. These maps display
    average temperature rises for Northern Hemisphere Summer time and winter
    time respectively. Use this to see some surprising results. For example,
    this shows us that while Europe has seen warmer summers, Northern America
    has on average had a higher increase in temperature in the winters.

      In 2020, global mean annual temperature change over land was the highest
      in the instrumental record, 1.71 ⁰C above the 1951–1980 climate normal
      (Figure 1).The global mean annual temperature change, averaged over the
      past decade (2011–2020) was 1.31 ⁰C and well above earlier periods. It was
      1.01 ⁰C in the previous decade (2001–2010) and 0.58 ⁰C in the decade
      before (1991–2000).

    Well, it’s up to you what you make of this data. But one thing that’s for
    sure is that the planet is warming. And this will change many things. We
    have linked to some articles we find interesting and insightful into what
    temperature rises mean for our lives, what causes it and why it’s important
    to tackle in the sidebar.

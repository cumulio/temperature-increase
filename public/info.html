    The data in the ‘Global Temperature Rise’ dashboard shows surface air
    temperature changes (⁰C) measured over the global land area during the
    period 1961-2020 for 190 countries and 38 territories. This data is made
    publicly available by the
    <a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET"
      >Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a
    >.

  </h2>
  <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">
    The dashboard will initialize for the date range 2010-2020. You can either
    select subregions, or for more accurate data, deselect all countries & areas
    first, and pick out explicitly the countries or areas you are interested in.

    At the bottom you will see 2 maps next to each other. These maps display
    average temperature rises for Northern Hemisphere Summer time and winter
    time respectively. Use this to see some surprising results. For example,
    this shows us that while Europe has seen warmer summers, Northern America
    has on average had a higher increase in temperature in the winters.
